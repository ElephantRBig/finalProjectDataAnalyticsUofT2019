Hey, Ian. 

So this excel file basically is a xcel file i was able to create with a webscraping program called
	Parsehub. 
	It was able to collect all my companies competitors shipping times, standard shipping cost and _
	at what price they start to offer free shipping, and where they are shipping from. 
This file may be interesting in terms of figuring where we stand in terms of competition with respect_
	to shipping attributes.

1) The only thing im editing at the moment is the column names. They are a bit too lengthy and contain 
	strings that are unnecessary.
