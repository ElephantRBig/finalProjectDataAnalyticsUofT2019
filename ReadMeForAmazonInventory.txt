So basically, this file is the amount of inventory the company has in Amazon's fullfillment inventory.

Im going to be cleaning it up abit, but im not sure how much. I haven't dealt with this data much except for 
	including it with my bsoses amazon report to check for various things. Nothing special.

1) With the inventory data, all of it seems informative.
	The only thing i don't understand it hte FNSKU, so i'll jsut delete that.
	As well, im going to seperate the timing of the date/time column.
		- So amazon does daily inventory report of the items in their inventory and they do this check
			at a very specific hour. Therefore, the timing of when they took the check doesn't matter
			but the date they took it on does. We can look at how inventory moves during days and 
			come to some conclusion about it, or revealing fact. idk.
	I'm going to do the seperation and deletion on excel, because it's faster and more efficient.
